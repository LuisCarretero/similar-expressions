# Similar Expressions Generator

A generative model project for creating algebraic expressions with similar semantics, primarily focused on symbolic regression applications.

## Project Structure
- `datagen/`: Data generation utilities
- `dev/`: Development and testing code
- `model/`: Core model implementation
- `ONNX_conversion/`: ONNX model conversion utilities
- `SR_benchmarking/`: Symbolic Regression benchmarking tools
- `train/`: Training scripts and configurations
- `utils/`: Helper utilities and common functions

## Project Overview
This project implements a generative model to create algebraic expressions that maintain similar semantic meaning while having different syntactic structures. The generative model is based on grammar-VAE architecture principles.
